            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore wee muſt herein imitate Mariners, who before they looſe off from the Port, doe furniſh themſelves with all things neceſſary and needefull for reſiſting of Tempeſts and ſtormes: and provide our ſelves aforehand of ſuch ſound and ſubſtantiall diſcourſe, as may anchor and ſtay the mind againſt the puſh of our paſſions, when as they, like ſo many ſurging waves, doe nil we, will wee, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow into our Boate; and as <hi>Xenophon</hi> did exhort his fellow Citizens to ſacrifice unto God in time of proſperity, to the end they might finde him the more ready and favourable, when as they ſhould invoke him in their

But if he ſhould bring a young Horſe to the Turney or Tilt, which had never before borne the Bit, or galloped the round, he muſt needes reape great diſcredit thereby; as not having before broken him with convenient Diſcipline, fit for a management of ſo great importance. In like manner, before we put our backs under the burthen of any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or expoſe our ſelves unto the publicke view of the world, wee muſt endeavour to breake and bring under this wilde and unbacked part of the ſoule, and make it, as it were, to bite upon

                        <hi>Meditation</hi> is a ſecret lifting up of the ſoule from vanity, and a fixation of the minde upon things really good and honeſt; and it is much helpt by Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which being a purity and elegancy of Speech, ſtirres up diſcourſe in the apprehenſive parts of man: and when it is connext with Meditation, they both give an edge unto the ſoule, and make it ſteele-hard

And truely man is not borne to live idlely; but rather, as one of the faireſt members of this faire frame, hee muſt-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, and contribute his whole travaile and paine to the condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conſervation of that civill ſocietie and condition wherein he is placed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11482:12"/>in the choyce which men make of a calling, their reſt and quietneſſe doth principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and that nothing doth ſo much availe to the leading of a contented life, as when they finde themſelves fit for the ſame: They ought before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, to take a tryall and ſurvey of their owne ſtrength, and ſeriouſly bethinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that charge which they are about to embrace: ſeeing u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually we preſume too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our owne power, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt more then our ability is fit to atchieve; this errour is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident almoſt to all our actions. And hence it is, that ſome will diſpend more then their meanes may well beare: And others in labouring and toyling, goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their abilities; ſome are not maſters of their own anger;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11482:12"/>others dallying, diſporting, and playing the pleaſant, will not ſpare any perſon, no not the Prince, although thereby they ſhould incurre the danger of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their Heads. Some are unapt to manage publicke affaires, being either of a fullen and ſolitary humour, or of a ſlacke and ſlow diſpoſition. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it doth not beſeeme to be at Court; for that they be either obſtinate in opinion, or uncour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in behaviour. And that which maketh us to fall into theſe faults, is that we doe not throughly ſee and looke into our ſelves. Whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that neglecting to take a true tryall of our owne ability, wee often undertake imployments of ſuch gravity and weight, as that afterwards wee muſt either abandon them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11482:13"/>with ignorance and ſhame; or elſe if we goe on with them, we muſt needs ſuffer much trouble and anxiety of ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Now that a man may the more warily weigh his occaſions, or affaires, before he put under his backe; let him remember, that alwayes the bearer muſt have more pith then the burthen for if it be huge &amp; too heavy, who ſeeth not that the undertaker muſt bee conſtrained either to leave, or elſe to lye downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; and conſider, that there are divers kinds of affaires, ſome whereof are hard and uneaſie; not ſo much for that they bee weighty &amp; important of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as for that they be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and mingled with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of toyleſome and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome buſineſſes which follow them? Therefore actions of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11482:13"/>this kinde, are to be ſhunned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the minde. And we ſhould rather make choyce of ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, as we may well and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly execute, or at leaſt with a reaſonable induſtry bring to an end. For alwayes it is a good thing to deſiſt from the profecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our begun buſineſſes, when as we ſhall finde, that they take not ſuch a courſe and way, as in the beginning was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and expected by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker. I ſay not this to affray, or diſmay, nor ſo to diſcourage any man, as to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and eſchew the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of neceſſary and needfull imployments, becauſe of the manifold encombrances and cares wherewith they may bee accompanied: ſo that not daring to intermeddle with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11482:14"/>any matter of moment, hee ſhould abide without ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe and charge, which were to lead a life both unprofitable and unpleaſant: Nature promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every man to liſten to ſomewhat, and chiefly unto ſuch things as be expedient and profitable for the Common-wealth. But I meane to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that ſeeing the life of man is naturally ſubject unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and paines, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him ſo wiſely, and warily to demeane himſelfe, that if it be his fortune to be called to the undertaking of vertuous and laudable actions, he neither be ſo feeble-hearted, as to ſhunne or relinquiſh them for their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; nor yet ſo foole-hardy, as to undertake ſuch affaires as goe beyond the reach of his power. And if the narrow

                     <p>If wee would take notice of things as wee ought, we ſhould rather finde occaſion to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile how that diſaſters and dangers which doe follow us at the heeles, have delaied ſo long to overtake us, and having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken

But we groſly deceive our ſelves, when as for feare that men take us to be timerous and fearefull, we thinke ill to forecaſt and foreſee dangers, and will not a whit miſtruſt our owne judgement. It behooveth the Pilot who is minded to ſet ſaile, to know that hee is in poſſibility of a ſtorme; ſo wee muſt know that the chance which hath happened to one, may likewiſe befal unto us, and that which hangeth over the heads of all, may fall upon any one, without exemption or exception whatſoever.

                     <p>But ſeeing that in this world, all things are ſubject to totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and turning and that there is nothing under the Cope of Heaven ſtable and firme: the Remedy moſt fit unto our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; is to fore-ſee this inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and not to paſſionate, and turmoyle ourſelves about thoſe things, the poſſeſſion whereof is no leſſe toyleſome and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, then was the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purchaſe thereof. And therefore we muſt love them as things which may leave us, and withall, have ſo much foreſight,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11482:19"/>that they never leave us firſt. When on a time it was told <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras</hi> that his Sonne was dead: <hi>I knew very well,</hi> quoth he, <hi>that he was a man, and that he was borne to dye once.</hi> In like manner, muſt wee bee prepared for all adventures.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11482:20"/>pietie to implore the aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of God; for patience with humilitie in Gods behalfe, is the remedie which doth moſt lighten and eaſe the evill. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider poore priſoners, at firſt what pains they endure to beare the burthen that is laid upon their legges, but after that they are once accuſtomed thereunto, neceſſity teacheth them, and uſe maketh all ſuch hard uſage eaſie unto them.

And truely there is not any one thing, wherein <hi>Nature</hi> hath ſo much favored us, as in this; that ſhe maketh us to finde the remedy, and mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our miſ-fortunes in the ſufferance of them.</p>
                     <p>The caſe then ſtanding as it

If the deſire of honour turmoileth thee, the deſire of riches doth trouble another.

For there is no calling, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Painefull and toyleſome it bee, wherein the patient ſoule doth not finde ſome content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gaine, though that cunning and skill be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in time of adverſity, then of proſperitie. For when as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and croſſes doe preſent

                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:11482:22"/>A Calling is the Tye of every man from Sloth; it gives him health, it drawes the mind from thinking on ſuch things as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate the Soule: By it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths have their true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, and are therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; becauſe upheld by continuall employment: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſt, when <hi>Honeſty</hi> ſteeres the courſe, and meane ones beare not envy againſt ſuch as are in higher places then they; for oftentimes that which wee account hight, is as a ſteepe hill, from whence a man with very little adoe is hurled downe headlong. And truely ſuch as have lived content, have not beene alwayes thoſe that have made the better choice: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe who prudently and diſcreetly could carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that eſtate and calling
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11482:23"/>which they once made choice of, taking patiently the evill that fell out therein, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to redreſſe ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as did croſſe their deſires. This advice likewiſe is required to keepe diſcretion, which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth, and giveth a taſte and relliſh to all things. And for this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> did compare the life of man to the play at Dice, whereat whoſoever doth play, ought alwayes to ſtrive to have a faire throw, and yet content himſelfe with any caſt that commeth. For ſeeing that good or evill lucke is not in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, at leaſt wiſe wee muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to take cheerefully our chance, and withall to thanke God, for that the worſt that could, is not fallen out. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as men of weake wit, having Fortune at will, are ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11482:23"/>with joy, that ſcarcely they know what they doe, they are ſo inſolent, that no man can keepe them company; they can abide no body, and no body can abide them. Whereas in the time of adverſity they are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed and ſo melancholy, that they are almoſt overwhelmed with ſorrow and heavineſſe of minde, yee ſhall ſee them like unto the ſicke of a languiſhing, and anguiſhing diſeaſe, which can neither abide heate nor cold.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever thy fortune be, beare it with patience, if thou art Low, ſtrive not to Emulate thoſe above thee, for in ſo doing the bowe which thou ſeekeſt to bend, wil fly back upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee; and if thou art high, contemne not thoſe meaner under thee: for that is to take up a ſtone to fling
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11482:24"/>at thy ſelfe; but ſo weigh both thy mind, and it, as that a golden meane may be the Center of all thy hopes.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Theodorus</hi> was wont to ſay, that he gave his Schollers inſtructions &amp; leſſons, with the right hand, but that they received them with the left, and ſo doth it fare often times not with a few, who with the left hand take hold of the lucke which fortune (I meane Gods providence) reacheth them with the right. It were much better in my judgement wiſely to imitate the wiſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Bees, the which of Thyme, which is but a dry and harſh hearb, do make the ſweet and pleaſant honey. So ſhould wee out of this harſh and comberſome life extract and draw whatſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11482:24"/>is good and chaſe away what is evill therein; or caſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it cloſely, and who knoweth not but that ſuch as are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the actions of <hi>Vertue,</hi> can draw by a certaine ſecret and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall kinde of Alchimy, good out of evill? <hi>Diogenes</hi> was baniſhed, but hee made good uſe of his baniſhment, in that he did in the meane time betake himſelfe unto the ſtudy of <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And this ſhall not be ſo difficult and hard to doe, as it ſeemeth to bee, if by frequent exerciſe yee doe endeavour to acquire the habitude and ſetled cuſtome of living content. Can yee not abide in the Houſes of Princes and Great men? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you then with your owne. Doe yee finde your ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of government in the Common wealth? play then
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11482:25"/>the good Citizens part, and be content to obey. Thus doing ye ſhall make unto your ſelves facile, and caſie, that which moſt men deeme to bee ſtrict and hard in the courſe of your life.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it ſhall much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile you in your diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to repreſent unto your ſelfe the great and fame us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages of the time paſt: how and with what wiſedome, and courage they have remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and borne the croſſes and calamities which befall them in this life. Doth it diſpleaſe you that you are deſtitute of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Conſider how many Kings, Princes, and Potentates, have dyed without iſſue. If poverty doth vexe you, weigh in your owne minde, how many excellent men have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11482:25"/>beene likewiſe poore; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe have lived patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whithout complaining. On a day it was told the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Stilphon,</hi> that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had done amiſſe: the fault (quoth hee) is not in mee but in her fortune and mine. To live is a gift, to dye is a debt: and then is that ranſome onely paid, which all thy life time was due to Nature for thy being, and this is much eaſed by the patience of a diſcreet man. If the churliſh and froward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your owne grieve you, ſet before your eyes ſo many wiſe, honourable and illuſtrious men, as have quietly comported with the importunities of theirs, <hi>Socrates</hi> had the moſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wife in the world, and hee ſaid that by enduring of her at home, hee did learne to bee

                     <p>The world is full of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and if wee did not love our ſelves ſo much as wee doe, it is certaine that in the greateſt croſſes and encomber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, wee ſhould finde comfort enough.

                     <p>There is likewiſe another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men not much unlike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the former, that cannot keepe themſelves quiet, nor bee at any ſtay, in any time, or in any place. They ceaſe not to goe and come, alwaies intermedling with affaires, without being thereunto called, and buſying and beſtirring themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which no wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth them. Theſe men when they goe out of doores, if yee but aske them whither they goe, they will anſwere you thus; <hi>I know not, I goe to doe as the reſt doe.</hi> They runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſtreets, they haunt the publicke places, and then they returne home full of vexation and wearineſſe, without any
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11482:28"/>deſigne: for there is nothing that doth ſo much irke and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mens mindes, as to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vaine. They are like unto little Ants, which doe climbe upwards upon trees, and after they have mounted to the toppe, are forced to creepe downe againe the ſame way they went up, without brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging downe with them any good at all. Many doe live in this manner, whoſe life is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a buſied leaſure full of tumults and toyles, yee ſhall ſee them poſting on with ſuch vehemency and ſpeede, as if they would carry away with them all that they finde before them in their way. The Streets, the Churches, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, are ordinarily ful of them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe bee they which forge, and frame newes: they will
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11482:29"/>bee the weighers of mens worthes, and the givers of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.

It is a principall point of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> truly to know how to eſteem of life; he that eſteemeth and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his life for the love of it ſelfe, hee lives not but to live: But a wiſe man lives no longer, then that his life may be worth more then his death; a great part of life is loſt to thoſe that doe ill; a greater to thoſe that doe nothing; and all to thoſe that doe that they ſhould not doe; ſome beginne to live when they ſhould dye; ſome ended before they beginne; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other evills, <hi>Folly</hi> hath this, that it alwaies beginnes to live.

                     <p>DIſſimulation comes from Diſtruſt, which is the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene or ſeed plot thereof: for if that were not, and that there were truſt and fidelity in all, diſſimulation which opneth the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; covereth the thought, could have no place. Now it is a great paine, &amp; a teſtleſſe mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind, for men to labour to appeare different in ſhew from that which they are in ſubſtance. And a marvellous trouble and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11482:38"/>torment it is, for them to take al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies heed unto themſelves, for feare leſt they ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Looke how often men looke on them, ſo often doe they think that they are eſpied: ſo that in the end it falleth our, that whether they will or no, they doe bewray the humour and inclination which beareth rule in their breaſt. The exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive care they have to hide their naturall humour, putteth them to an unexplicable paine: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to be diſcovered, it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to almoſt an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhame. So that in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and masked kind of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age there is not that pleaſure and eaſe, which is to be felt in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain &amp; ſimple kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation that Nature doth lead each man unto. And though there be ſome little danger ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11482:38"/>this plainneſſe, that a man may bee the leſſe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of by reaſon of this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination when it is diſcried: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in my mind, it wer better for him to be a little leſſe accounted of, and to live open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then with ſuch paine to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and carry himſelfe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly. And yet in both the two there is to be kept a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mediocrity and meane: for there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a franke and free faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of behaviour, and a negligent or careleſſe kind of carriage.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand this point ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better, wee have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how that Nature hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued man with two diverſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and properties, the one generall and common to us all, in making us reaſonable and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcourſe, wherein

In this every one ſhould follow his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination, provided that it bee not abſurd, unſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or vitious. As if a man her ſubject to too much laughter, in behoveth him to endeavour to amend this imperfection. But in ſuch qualities, as are not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it is good not to uſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting, cloaking, or diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For it is a thing very uneaſy for that man alwaies to Act the grave, who is not naturally enclined to gravity, as to change his countenance, to enlarge or raiſe ſwellingly his voyce, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion &amp; frame his eyes &amp; lookes to auſterity, majeſty, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: The which geſtures if a

                     <p>In my conceit it were much better for ſuch a man to follow his in-bred cheerefull inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gay humour in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with others.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, if it bee a mans fortune to be preferred to a place of dignitie and honour, ſuch as doth require a grave, or ſevere countenance and cariage, then in this caſe it behoveth him to conſtraine and command a little his joviall inclination. But this muſt be don with much diſcretion and moderation, and by degrees, and in ſuch ſort that this change offend no man. And this kinde of diſſembling, or diſguiſing of humours cannot bee blamed; ſeeing the quality of his charge doth require it, for

                     <p>If wee would rehearſe in this place all thoſe which have miſerably miſcarried by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and violent Death, becauſe that they could not in their proſperity moderate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter themſelves. The Story would bee too tedious; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our intention to uſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, wee will therefore leave that <hi>Diſcourſe:</hi> For ſcarcely ſhall wee finde any man, who hath not ſome Knowledge thereof: And therefore when as we enjoy the ſmiling favour of time, wee ought diligently

                     <p>True it is, there are ſome which ſuſtaine ſuch a ranke and dignity, that they cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently debaſe themſelves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they either fall from their place, or at leaſt, not carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame as they ought.

For it is a like vice for a man not to know how to carry himſelfe in his proſperity, as not to be able to comport with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: wee ought therefore to obſerve an equality in our whole life, and to ſhew alwaies (if it be poſſible) in all the changes and chances therof one and the ſame countenance, full of curteſie, mildneſſe and gentle in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11482:48"/>to himſelfe the cauſe of his own good hap. Neither is there any other Seaſon in which men ſooner forget God, then when they enjoy health and wealth, dignity and felicity according to their wiſh. So that miſhap whenſoever it doth happen them, doth ſerve them for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, becauſe it bringeth them home againe unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This opinion of ſelfe-conceit, for a man to thinke too much of himſelfe, and to give credit lightly unto the fawning lyes of flatterers, maketh men to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to fall into many groſſe faults, yea, giveth occaſion of mocking and bitter reviling, and out of all queſtion, it is a great over-ſight, and a folly, for a man to relie more upon anothers judgment concerning himſelfe,

                     <p>IT is an ancient queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> hath moſt credit: For it is out of all doubt, that both have; and it is clearely falſe; that one onely doth all, and the other nothing; and commonly they that ſettle themſelves unto the one, contemne the other; but the difficulty is to joyne them together, and to attend them both.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is much availea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the attaining of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of minde, that a man ſetting aſide all paſſions, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with himſelfe what meanes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11482:49"/>and commodities hee doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and in the next place, that he ſet before his eyes ſuch men as have not ſo much: not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many are wont, who have their eyes onely upon ſuch as ſurpaſſe them, admiring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting them onely happy and bleſſed. The priſoners hold them happy that are ſet at large; and againe, thoſe eſteeme ſuch bleſſed as are altogether free. The free thinke the rich onely fortunate, and the rich againe thoſe that command. They that command, account Kings of all other moſt bleſſed, and Kings thoſe of their degree that excell them in ability and power. Hence it is, that men finding themſelves unable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall ſuch as ſurpaſſe them, they doe remaine diſcontented, and no wiſe ſatisfied with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11482:50"/>wherein they both bewray their ingratitude towards God, and beget a torment to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A wiſe man will not be male content, though many ſurmount him in meanes, but rather repreſenting to himſelfe the great numbers of afflicted and miſerable men the world doth afford, he will rejoyce and bee glad of his condition and caſe. If ye ſee then a man well mounted and furniſhed with faire horſes, richly arayed, doe but caſt downe a little your eyes, and conſider how many there are that goe a foot, which leading a poore life, eſteem that of yours to be happy, for it is not reaſonable that the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of one, or of a few, ſhould have greater force to make you diſcontent, then ſhould the bad fortune of many have to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11482:50"/>move you to be content. How many poore folkes ſee yee daily that live of their labours; and are laden with children, &amp; pinched with poverty, and which is worſt of all, have no hope at all to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape out of their miſery? How many is there to whom your life, which ye ſo much deplore, would bring much conſolation and eaſe? Fortune may make a man poore, ſick, afflicted, but not vitious, diſſolute, dejected: many times a man complaineth unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for though he be ſometimes ſurprized with ſome ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet hee is more often with a good, and ſo the one muſt recompence the other: and if a man conſider wel thereof, he ſhall finde more reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe with his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, then to complaine of his bad. We are come to a time ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11482:51"/>miſerable, that one mans life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth more of anothers then of it ſelfe; and the good of our Neighbour doth occaſion us greater griefe then is the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we reape of our owne. But if it were poſſible for men to ſee unfolded the fortune of ſuch as they eſteeme happy, they would feele and find in it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more anxiety and paine, then they do in their own. Who is he that doth not account the condition of Kings of all other to be moſt happy? And yet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what a great King ſaith of himſelfe in <hi>Homer; Great Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath impriſoned mee with great perplexities and cares.</hi> O how happy then are thoſe that live in their little corners out of theſe dangers and feares! And if it be ſo that ten thouſand folks would bee content with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11482:51"/>wherein God hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed you, what reaſon have you to complaine, for that yee have not the eſtate &amp; fortune of one whom yee envy? Yee have no cauſe at all to kill your ſelfe with ſorrow and care, for to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto another mans ranke, ſeeing there is nothing that ſo much roubleth and tormenteth a man, as this affection and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate deſire of mounting from one degree of dignity to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. For ſuch folkes ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily do follow without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration any hope whatſoever that offereth it ſelfe; the which if it faile to ſucceede according to their wiſh, they preſently beginne to accuſe Fortune, and to accurſe their hard hap; whereas they ought rather to blame themſelves for their raſhneſſe &amp; lightneſſe, and their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11482:52"/>want of fore-ſight. Neither doe they conſider what a folly it is for them, to impure unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother the blame of their owne weake underſtanding, and the fault they have fallen into, by following that which was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncertaine, or impoſſible for them to attaine unto. They are like unto thoſe, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which fret and fume for that they cannot fly, or ſhoote an arrow with a bow as big as a plow-beame.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this evill, is the exceſſive affection men beare unto themſelves: Whence it happens, that in all things they will needs ſtrive and labour to bee the firſt. It is nothing in their eye to abound in Wealth, except they have much more then other rich men have.</p>

Behold how this vice reigneth, or rather rangeth in all eſtates. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the firſt was not content to bee King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> neither eſteemed hee his dignity accompliſhed enough, becauſe <hi>Philoxenus</hi> did ſurpaſſe him in Poëſie, and <hi>Plato</hi> in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. Wherupon hee was ſo furious, that he condemned <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus</hi> to the quarries, there to wring Verſes out of the hard rocks, and baniſhed <hi>Plato</hi> out of his country. But it were good that he &amp; all other complainers did practiſe the ſaying of a wiſe man, that if al the evils that men ſuffer, ſhold be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>par'd with the bleſſings they injoy, the diviſion

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11482:54"/>fooles, but that hee had never ſeen, nor heard any man uttering ſo many fond and fooliſh words as that man did, whom they all ſo much admired. And not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe did he anſwer them in this wiſe: conſidering how that this man did take upon him to diſcourſe largely and laviſhly of a matter which very hardly can be taught or learned in the ſhade of a Schoole, and that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and audience of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Captaine, and moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented warriour that was then in the whole world. Which may teach every man to containe himſelfe within the compaſſe of his calling, without medling or troubling himſelfe with that of another mans. The which thing the Poets alſo have taught us, when as they faine that their gods doe content themſelves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:11482:54"/>each one with his owne calling and charge. <hi>Mars</hi> medleth with warre, <hi>Minerva</hi> with arts, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> with eloquence, <hi>Cupid</hi> with love, <hi>Neptune</hi> with the ſea, <hi>Pluto</hi> with Hell, <hi>Iupiter</hi> with the heavens, and ſo of the reſt, each one keeping himſelfe within the bounds and liſts of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.

                     <p>How ill a fooles cap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the head of a wiſe man; and yet through that diſguiſe he is diſcerned to be diſcreet, when all the choiſeſt garments in the world cannot cover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a foole. And hence we may gather, that all things doe not be fit, nor become all men, and that each one ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

For theſe kind of people make no account at all of that which they have, but onely of that which they would have: they goe alwaies looking a farre off, and little

The picture was of a Rope-maker who did ſtil work, but ſuffered an Aſſe that ſtood behinde him to eat it up. And thus doe the ingrate people in Gods behalfe, who make no reckoning of the goods they enjoy, but ſuffer them to be buried in oblivion, and are alwaies covetous of things to come. In the harmony of the world, the differences, or diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to bee obſerved: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in humane things, all are not of one ſort.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11482:71"/>and almoſt an unſupportable paine to behold wiſe and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men afflicted, troubled, and vexed, yea to bee ill-uſed, and trampled; as it were, under feet by the vaine world, and to ſay the truth, it ſeemeth that this doth touch us very neere: for when as wee weigh with our ſelves that the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and lot of vertuous men is no other but affliction, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of minde, we do thereupon preſently imagine, that thereby our beſt hopes are hemmed in.</p>
                     <p>If then ſuch a caſe diſquiet you thinke with your ſelfe, that if they be honeſt and patient men, then are they in that caſe ſo much the more happy, becauſe that in this life which is ſo ſhort, they purchaſe to themſelves a life eternall in the heavens, for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11482:71"/>ye muſt know that the firſt good which ſuch as go to reſt in Gods houſe doe obtaine, is to bee quit and diſcharged from the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and torments of this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome life.</p>
                     <p>Afflictions on earth are as ſo many good companions unto the godly; which though of themſelves unworthy, yet make their cauſe the better, who ayme at a higher end then the blinded eyes of the ignorant without dazling can behold; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the maſter of their owne hopes, before others perceive them in trouble. The heavens are their onely proſpect where they behold the creator of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his height of wonder, and themſelves are the Mine into which they dive, to finde reaſon Tryumphant by which they governe their inſurrective paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11482:72"/>Moreover, ſet before your eyes the roll and ſcroll of holy men of old, the bleſſed Martyrs of Chriſt, of whom ſome have beene beheaded, others have beene hanged; ſome have beene burnt, and others have beene broyled; ſome haue beene cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and others have had their skinne pulled off. Beſides that during their life they have been afflicted with hunger, nakednes, and neede: of whom certainely the world was not worthy, and therefore it had them in horrour as thoſe in whom it had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at al. But God loved them deerely, and by his divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, appointed them to paſſe through ſuch Tribulations, as through a needles eye, into the place of perpetuall repoſe. Yea
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11482:72"/>the paines and perplexities that vertuous men doe endure, doe even pricke them forwards to have a more earneſt deſire to loath, and to leave this wretched world. So that in the end they diſlodge out of a bad and ſad priſon, they eſcape and ſlip out of the darke caves and obſcure corners, and having no deepe apprehenſion of death, they finde the faire beaten way that leadeth them to a better life.</p>

                     <p>NOw joy begins to budde, and the bloſſomes of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city appeare, yet after that yee have thus diſpoſed of yourſelfe,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11482:73"/>and have appeaſed your owne paſſions; yet ſhall yee have the vices of others, and the faults which are done in publicke, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an on-ſet againſt you to trouble your minde. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great diſorder that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; which is ſo great, that ſcarſely there cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be found in the roome where it ought to be; and that there is hardly any one that doth the duty whereunto by birth and calling hee was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The man who ſhould prove a wiſe Judge, is a ſimple Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen: and he that ought to be but a meere citizen is made a Judge, and that man doth command who ought to obey.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſtrange thing to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how that almoſt every thing is corrupt and ſold, and how that, as it were; all things
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11482:73"/>are turned upſide downe. To ſee how that the poore man is puniſhed for every petty treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and the puiſant and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon is ſpared: to ſee, I ſay, how the whole plotting &amp; plodding of men now a daies, is altogether for money; when as riches are but the gifts of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but goodneſſe of God himſelfe; and canſt thou thinke that hee that created man good, hath not beſtowed a greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on him, then thoſe whom fortune hath made rich: what if thou beeſt poore, content thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt finde greater conſolation in that, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then the bad, and rich ſhall with all their ſtore.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it cannot but bring griefe unto a good mans minde, to conſider how ſmall occaſion and example of living vertuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11482:74"/>ſuch perſons do miniſter unto us, as hold the chiefe offices, and the firſt rankes in the Common wealth. The vertuous man is holden every where as a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; abhorred, deſpiſed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. And what ſhall a man ſay, when as hee weigheth with himſelfe the variable &amp; mutable diſpoſition of the multitude, one while loving, and another while loathing, at one time praiſing, at another time diſpraiſing, one and the ſame thing, one and the ſame party? How many bee the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable changes that fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men? And what a hard caſe is it, when men make none account of that they ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently heare: and on the other ſide harken to that whereunto they ſhould rather ſtop the eare. The deſpite and diſlike that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have conceived, by reaſon of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11482:74"/>ſuch courſes, hath made them bid the world fare well, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into deſerts and ſolitarie aboads, as not being able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with their eyes, that which did breed, &amp; bring ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to their mindes, whoſe intentions were wholy bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which was really good, laudable, and honeſt. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch have choſen to live ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt the wild beaſts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the vaſte wilderneſſe, and rocky mountains, then amongſt ſo many wilde men, ſwarming with vile and wicked manners.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſſe, in theſe, and ſuch other occurrents as cannot be amended, man muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand and maſter his <hi>minde,</hi> and carry himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that theſe unamendable evills make him not to abhorre the company
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11482:75"/>and ſocietie of men: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee muſt take occaſion thereof, to bee the more watchfull and wary, leſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of thoſe that forget to carry themſelves diſcreetly amongſt men; he muſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt hee miniſter occaſion to another, to blame in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that which he doth blame in his neighbour. A man muſt hold more on <hi>Democritus</hi> then on <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> for he did weepe alwaies at the faults he ſaw men fall into; but <hi>Democritus</hi> did laugh at them: To the one, all that men doe, did ſeeme to be but miſery, to the other fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and folly. And it ſeemeth to be the better of the twaine, when as things amiſſe cannot be amended, that wee ſweeten them a little, if it were but in covering them with the cloake
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11482:75"/>of a faire ſhew, it being a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-hood more conſonant to mans nature, to laugh at the manifold miſeries of our life, then mourningly to bewaile them with teares.</p>
                     <p>But yet yee ſhall do better, if that for the vices of other men, and ſuch as are done in publick, yee do keepe a mediocrity and meane, neither alwayes lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not yet alwayes laughing at them: for it is both a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kinde of diſpoſition, for a man to afflict himſelfe exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, by reaſon of another mans miſcarriage, and a pittileſſe kinde of paſſe-time to be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes thereat.</p>
                     <p>But there be ſome, to whom this advice will ſeeme to be of no weight: for not onely they cannot comport with the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their friends, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11482:76"/>thoſe of their enemies do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them. Their honours, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencies, wrongs, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencies vexe them: the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of their friends, the way wardneſſe and peeviſhneſſe of their Servants, and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance trouble and torment them daily. But how much better were it to have patience in ſuch accidents, chiefly ſeeing they winne ſo little by willing and wiſhing the amendment therof: Ye muſt rather imagine &amp; think with your ſelfe, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> theſe men, which thus take pleaſure to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy you, are as dogs which be borne to barke. And impute all this evill to their perverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein they are enough puniſhed by the means of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall peoplexity, which pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and peirceth their mind.</p>
                     <p>But if your weakneſſe be ſuch,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:11482:76"/>as to ſtumble at al that yee ſee ill done, by ſuch as are about you, yee are then, in that caſe meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>y forlorne. For if the vices of ſtrangers, or of thoſe that be your owne, come once to win ground on you, to cloſe with you, and to overcome you, yee ſhal be abaſhed, and amazed to ſee how that all ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and troubles, like water, ſhall run into you, as the raine doth from the gutter into the baſe cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, or from a ſteepe hill into a low valley. And out of all queſtion it is to be undiſcreetly tender-hearted for a man to be alwayes ſorry, when thoſe with whom we do hant, do not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine us ſo carefully, or reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively as we deſire. Hee that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voideth converſation, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in effect, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the power of his Creation;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:11482:77"/>therefore hee ought ſo to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple himſelfe, as that his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may be pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto all men, to the intent that <hi>Love, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> may be preſerved.</p>
                     <p>The immoderate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee beare unto our ſelves, doth deceive us, and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of our owne condition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that we cannot beare with the defects and neglects of our ſervants, we not conſidering how that very often they know not how to do any better. We require at their hands perfect things, when as yet we our ſelves doe fall into ſo many faults, and are ſubject unto ſo many imperfections.</p>
                     <p>And moſt often wee play the paſſionate and fretting mans part in our ſervants behalfe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being moved by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:11482:77"/>that our owne ill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe occaſion unto us, or by the quality and kind of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have in hand: and thus fooliſhly wee caſt the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them which are innocent, and do the beſt they can. The angry was never a good man, and hee that perverſely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes his owne paſſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out balancing his actions, ſhuts himſelfe out of this Kingdome of reaſon and <hi>Humane</hi> ſociety: be not raſh, but weigh anothers faults in thine owne ſcalls, ſo when thou commeſt to bee weighed in them thy ſelfe; thou ſhalt finde thy ſinnes ſo much the lighter, by how much thou haſt borne with the errors of others.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another thing which doth bring unto us much diſquiet, and that is to affect too
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:11482:78"/>much one and the ſame thing, and therupon to fall into debate with our friends. For there was never yet any perfect friendſhip amongſt them which are led and miſcaried with an obſtinate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and contention who ſhall overcome. If ye belabor, &amp; accuſtome your ſelfe, through exerciſe, to frame your ſelfe to times and perſons, ye may eaſily governe and rule men at your wil, and withal purge them from ſuch evill humours as yee finde them ſubject unto. And whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall fall out, that it ſhall ſeeme unto you a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to comport with them; thinke that it is your fault, and that this floweth from your owne inability: conſidering how that ſo many others could, and yet can very well comport with the ſame.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11482:80"/>the ſigne of this anger is, when it appeareth in the countenance; thirdly when we intend action by law for wrongs; we are bound to pardon the firſt, although our enemy ſue it not of us; wee are bound to pardon the ſecond, when our enemy ſues it of us; but wee are not bonud alwaies to pardon the third; for there are ſome men, which could pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently comport with all other kinde of affliction, onely they cannot away with an indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wrong. The which thing, nevertheleſſe, befalleth them more for being perſwaded that the injury offered them is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, then for that it is ſo of its owne nature. In which caſe one thing may availe you much; if yee can reſolve with your ſelfe to keepe you aloofe from the common opinion, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:11482:81"/>if yee can conſider without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, each one of the things that are wont thus to toile, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moile mens mindes. For in ſo doing, yee ſhall ſee, if yee have reaſon to thinke upon the wrong offered you ſo immoderately as yee doe.</p>
                     <p>There is one kinde of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which we call an injury, or wrong, that is, when any one overthwarteth us in our affaires againſt all equity and right. And there is another kinde which we call an indignity, or affront, when as in our body, or name, wee are uſed by word or deede otherwiſe then is fitting.</p>
                     <p>For both theſe kindes, yee ought to know, that the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man is not ſubject to receive any wrong: not that I doe meane that there is none to offer and to inferre wrong, for there
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11482:81"/>is nothing ſo ſacred, but there will be found ſacrilegious hands to touch it. But that though there bee not wanting multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men, whoſe tongues and hands have no other, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but to defile, and diminiſh, ſo much as in them lyeth, the honour of God, and of men: yet, for all that, the vertuous mans mind is not a whit the leſſe aſſured: &amp; though that ſuch miſchievous, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men, levell right at him to hit, and to hurt him with their harmefull ſhaft, yet doe they come ſhort of their aime; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they hit him not, or if they do, they hurt him not all: for an inviolable thing is not ſimply that which cannot be hit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which being hit, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thereby no hurt or at leaſt, careth not at all for it. And thus
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11482:82"/>doth it fare with the vertuous man, who of himſelfe offereth no man any occaſion of offering him any wrong. But his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is ſo levell and even, his love ſo meeke and humble, that even the vicious admire him. And if it fall out, that a man, out of a proud &amp; haughty ſtomack, or rather out of a malitious diſpoſition ſet upon him, and aſſaile him, hee is then in that caſe like a brazen wall, which the darts of the wicked cannot pierce through.</p>
                     <p>Moreover; we know that the vertue and vigour of him, who in fighting hath vanquiſhed his adverſary, is alwayes greater then his who never did try the combate at all. And even the very ſame muſt wee thinke and ſay of the vertuous wight, and well diſpoſed perſon: who, like
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11482:82"/>to good mettall, the more he is fired, the more he is fined; the more he is oppoſed, the more is he approved. Wrongs may wel try him, touch him, or pricke him, but they cannot imprint in him any falſe ſtampe. And if (peradventure) ſome flout, or affront be flung upon him, yet doth hee in the meane time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firme and unremoved; he maketh no reckoning, nor yet taketh any notice thereof, as aſſuring himſelfe that it doth not reach ſo farre as unto him. Adde alſo hereunto, that there is almoſt no man, but hee will hold the wrong-offerer for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the wrong-ſufferer for honeſt, as not deſerving any ſuch outragious uſage. The force and ſtrength of his <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> appeareth ſo much the more in this kind of adverſity, and his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11482:83"/>mildnes and meekneſſe of <hi>mind,</hi> ſhineth ſo much the more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by how much the more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and grievous the wrong of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was. But unto ſuch as are of a more cowardly and baſe courage, an indignity is more uneaſie to be borne withall.</p>
                     <p>But would you ſee how men doe meaſure wrongs by opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Such vanity there is in the things of this World, that ſome will make leſſe adoe for a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy blow, then for a light boxe on the eare. Yea, ſome will make a greater ſtirre for a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing hard word, then they would doe for a deadly blow with a ſharpe weapon. We are fallen into ſuch blindneſſe and babiſhneſſe, that <hi>opinion</hi> annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us more then the Soare it ſelfe, being like unto little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which are amazed at a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:11482:83"/>mummers maske. If it chance that a man bee hindered, or wronged in his goods, it is a wonder to conſider what a coyle hee doth keepe about them. But the diſcreet and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayed perſon; who judgeth of things according to <hi>reaſon,</hi> not meaſuring them by <hi>opinion,</hi> as he holdeth all things, even as if it were by borrowing, ſo hee feeleth the loſſe of them, as if they were things in no part his. And even as he ſhould not ceaſe to be content, though he had never had them at all, ſo he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the loſſe of any part of them, as the neceſſary out-caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or forgoing of one portion to ſave another, in the middeſt of a tempeſtuous ſtorme. Yea the forgoing of his whole goods wil not make him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his owne worth and vigour
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11482:84"/>of minde: he knowing well that not onely his goods, but alſo his life, honour, and whole happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth onely depend upon him who is the giver of every good thing. Such a one perhaps hath couzened you of ſo many crownes, hath deceived you of ſo many Ducates. Well, it is a damage he hath done you, yet is it a loſſe but of a part onely of your goods, &amp; not of the whole. And the man that hath the heart to give or forgoe the whole, can he bee much ſorry to let goe, or looſe apart.</p>
                     <p>But if it bee the manner of your loſſe which doth moſt vexe you: then yee have to thinke, that as your vertue would have you comport with <hi>Fortune</hi> and her frownes; ſo ought yee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to beare with inſolent and audacious men, which are no
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:11482:84"/>thing elſe but the hookiſh hands of the ſame hard fortune. And truſt me, our impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth us much more harme, then thoſe of whoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injuſtice we do ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly complaine.</p>
                     <p>What? (will ſome ſay) ſuch a one did diſdaine to put off his hat to me; ſuch another in ſpeaking to me did not uſe that reſpect in my behalfe as hee ought, and I thought he ſhould have don ſuch a one did not give me place, but ſate him down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and ſuch another would not give mee the wall. What tearmes, I pray you, be all theſe, but meere plaints flowing from the ſoft and feeble courage of an effeminate mind?</p>
                     <p>Divers things diſpleaſe us, which otherwiſe would not doe ſo, if we had the will to conſter
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:11482:85"/>them aright, and to take them in the better part; whereas through our owne indiſcretion, and diſtruſt of our ſelves, wee make that an indignity which of its owne nature is none; in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee judge our ſelves well worthy thereof, and what other thing is this but lack of courage, thogh we feele the wrong never ſo ſenſible, not to be able to tread it, and to trample it under our feet?</p>
                     <p>And if wee will but weigh and obſerve how, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the nightly viſions and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of dangers, which do preſent themſelves in our dreames do ſuddenly vaniſh, and ſometimes doe make us laugh when we remember them, wee ſhould doe well to endeavour to doe the like in our injuries, to thinke when as any wrong is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11482:85"/>done us, that we doe but awake out of a dreaming ſleepe: a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and well-diſpoſed man (aſſure your ſelfe) will bee loath to wrong you in your body, goods or good name; and as for any ill-diſpoſed wretch, what ſhall it availe you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, ſeeing that he is no more his owne man, then if hee were madde? If the good affect you, and applaud your laudable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, why ſhould you feare the malice of the wicked, ſeeing that the firſt are rewarded with a crowne, but theſe with folly; ye will willingly endure any thing at the hands of a man that is out of his wits, neither will he make any complaint for ought he hath ſaid or don to you, but wil rather pity his caſe: even ſo muſt yee beare with the miſ-behaviour of a fooliſh undiſcreet perſon,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:11482:86"/>who is no better then a man diſtracted: yee will endure well enough what a Jeſter or ſporter will ſay unto you, be it never ſo unpleaſant, and would thinke it but a baſe part for you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme againſt, or to complaine upon ſuch a perſon, as if hee chance to utter any pleaſing word amidſt his carping diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, yee take it and taſte it as a ſavory diſport. Conſider ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how unfitting and unſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thing it were that the ſame word uttered by one, ſhould cauſe you to laugh, and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lowre: the caſe ſo ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the man that is in choler, hath no more judgment then a ſimple Jeſter hath; if hee have ſo much.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſay, if a man have offended his neighbour, he muſt goe and ſeeke reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11482:86"/>of him; but if he will not be reconciled, hee ſhall take three men with him, who ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for him, and ſeeke reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation: but if hee yet will not pardon him, this is a great ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to be ſo cruell, and then he leaves his neighbour inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that are offended with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boyes, and ſilly women? perſons that doe offend rather of weakneſſe, then of a wilfull or wicked deſigne? for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion yee ſhall never attaine to tranquillity of minde, if yee take in ill part every croſſe chance that doth offer it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Some will ſay, this offence may bee well borne with', but that others muſt not bee borne with at all. But theſe men doe ſhut up vertue into a too ſtraite roome, and confine her abilities

If the injury hath his birth from your miſ-behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yee muſt thinke then, that it is not ſo much a wrong as a correction: and this yee ought to receive diſcreetly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all make uſe of it as a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your owne miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. If it chance that a man flout you for ſome imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your perſon, becauſe the features of your body are not to their minde, take not this to heart as a revengable wrong:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:11482:87"/>for it is but a meere folly, for a man to care much for that which falleth not out through his owne fault. <hi>Fidus Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did weepe for very anger in the Senate, becauſe <hi>Corduba S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But what miſerable blindneſſe is it for a man to vexe himſelfe, becauſe another doth imitate his moode or manner of going. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rather were this, if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> hath laid upon you any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or blemiſh which doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your body, ſpeake of it firſt your ſelfe, as knowing it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other: for by this meanes yee ſhall take away from others all occaſion of ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or flouting you for it.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11482:88"/>Thus <hi>Vatinius</hi> was wont to mocke himſelfe, in regard of his necke, and feet which were ſomewhat deformed: ſo that his enemies and il-willers could not take any advantage thereof to breake upon him any bitter jeſt. Moreover it is not a ſmal policy to deprive the party that doth you wrong, of all the pleaſure hee entendeth to reape, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your peace, as not thinking him worthy of ſo much as one word of your mouth, of by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him there where ye found him, diſdaining to brable or quarell with him, to take any notice of the man, or of his manners: if ye will be adviſed by me, make never anſwer to an inſolent malapert perſon, for in holding your tongue ye leave with him lying in his mouth, yea in his minde, his vice, folly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11482:88"/>and raſhneffe, whereas in anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, ye ſhall conforme your ſelfe to his naughty nature. There is nothing that equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth ſo much men among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the participation of one and the ſame vice: neither can there any ſuch chaſtiſement befall unto an ill-humored man as to make no reckoning, but to let vaniſh with the winde his vaine and unſavory words, for both by your ſilence are his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches condemned of impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and he deprived of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he promiſed to himſelfe by provoking him to anger.</p>
                     <p>Jeaſts are the ſuperfluity of their diſcretion who make it a paſtime, to revile, and a ſport to condemne others; they ſpare non, &amp; had rather ſuffer then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their thoughts: they are like a woman with child, who
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11482:89"/>longs to be delivered, although the birth may prove abortive; and therefore it likewiſe beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a man to bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and wary in his jeſting at others. For we finde by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that men doe commonly flie the company of ſuch as make profeſſion of ſcoffing and deriding. Wee finde likewiſe, that no man can entertaine a certaine Amity and unfaileable Friendſhip with ſuch a one as is averſe from pardoning ſuch as have offended him. For a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and Heroicke ſpirit will yeeld to <hi>fortune</hi> as he ſees occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: He will not ſtrive to ſwim againſt the ſtreame, nor ſayle againſt the Winde.

To uſe ſuch bitter taunts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth want of diſcretion, and not to be able to digeſt them, doth argue lacke of courage. <hi>Socrates</hi> hearing himſelfe flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his face, did no other thing but laugh thereat, without making any ſhew of a diſpleaſed mind.

And it is true courage and magnanimity, for a man to put up wrongs, to diſ-eſteeme, and not to be moved by them, but to command his affections, and to overcome his paſſions.

This is a kinde of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, and that which we feare to loſe, is our riches, and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, when ſuch poverty is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be deſired, then feared: And therfore the Wiſe man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of God neither <hi>Poverty</hi> nor <hi>Riches,</hi> but things neceſſary. He
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11482:92"/>that can make that reckoning of life and death that he ought, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> can never afflict or bereave him of his reſt: For it were a thing very unfitting, that he who can deſpiſe death, ſhould ſuffer his courage to be caſt downe, or to be quite quelled by <hi>poverty</hi> and need which nevertheleſſe is that the common people doe moſt apprehend, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine on, when as they cannot attaine unto a ſufficiency of goods whereupon to maintaine themſelves in a gay and gallant manner. They not being able to content themſelves with ſuch things as may ſerve for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; but eſteeming Wealth mans ſoveraigne good; and Poverty and Want his chiefeſt evill. And yet were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man not to have at all, then to loſe it when hee
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:11482:93"/>hath it? And how is it poſſible in this life that ſome ſhould not loſe, ſeeing that one cannot be rich, except many other bee poore, and many cannot inherit, except others do die? And yet there is in poverty this conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that as it is not ſubject to the receiving and incurring of great damages, ſo is it not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous turmoiles as plenty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wiſedome</hi> if ſhee be poore is never reſpected: fooles haue the fortune, and that not without good reaſon; for they have the moſt neede of it. Deſert if ſhe be meane, may to the Cart, there is no roome for her in Court, where judgement lookes a ſquint, and caſts her eyes but upon outward adjuncts, unleſſe ſhe be perfumed and ruffle in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:11482:93"/>her ſilkes; let her avoide the gates of greatneſſe. And to thinke that rich men have more courage to comport with loſſes then other men have, is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. For the paine of a ſoare is as ſenſible and dolorous in a bigge body, as in a ſmall; yea wee ſee ordinarily, that the greateſt men are the moſt tender and delicate.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Bion</hi> was wont to ſay, that the paine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like which is felt by plucking, or pulling the haires from an head that hath many, and from that which hath few.</p>
                     <p>All the difference that can be, is this; that the balde head hath leſſe haire to looſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot feele ſo much ſmart as the other doth that is full of haires.</p>
                     <p>If thou wilt live according
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:11482:94"/>to <hi>nature,</hi> thou ſhalt never bee poore; if according to opinion, never rich: Nature deſireth little, opinion much, and beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Moderate and quiet pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the law of nature is great riches, and godlineſſe is great gain with ſufficiency, and hence it is that we ſee, for the moſt part, the poorer ſort of people to bee more jocund and joyfull then commonly the richer ſort are, becauſe they have not ſo great care as they have, neither doe they feare ſo deeply the ſtorme of adverſity, as they doe. For they are eaten up with this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worm, the care of conſerving and increaſing the goods they have got, &amp; the feare of loſing that which they enjoy. But po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is a caſtle and fort, aſſured and fenced againſt fortune, yea the whole world. Shee feareth
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:11482:94"/>nothing, and is able withall to defend her ſelfe againſt all her enemies. Thouman who ſoever thou art that goeſt drooping and dying for riches, for worldly pelfe, and wealth, tell me I pray thee, if ſince thou haſt got them, they have brought unto thee any more knowledge unto thy <hi>minde,</hi> or more <hi>Tranquillity</hi> and peace unto thy ſpirit, or more reſt and happineſſe unto thine heart, then thou hadſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy came into thine hands? The wiſe men among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then have taught us, how much poverty is to be priſed and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when as they did portrait and paint their Gods naked, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing unto them all things according as they conceited to be moſt befitting their natures: and as for my ſelfe, I ſhall never repute that man poore, who
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:11482:95"/>is placed without the reach and power of fortune. There is one thing ſufficient to expreſſe unto us the nature of poverty, to wit, that no vertuous man ſpeaketh thereof, but hee praiſeth it; and avoucheth that the wiſeſt have bin thoſe who have ſuffered the ſame with moſt contentment, and truely it is a great weakneſſe and tenderneſſe in us, not to bee able to endure that which ſo many others have paſſed through, and it can be no other thing but a vaine apprehenſion and frivolous feare to endure and ſuffer, which maketh us ſo feeble hearted; for if we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede of a generous and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous diſpoſition, we would love and like that for our ſelves which we approve in others: and therefore howſoever this pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſſe and ſoftneſſe of ours is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:11482:95"/>not altogether to be comported with; we ought at leaſt to limite our affections, and dreſſe our ſelves in ſuch ſort that fortune may finde the leſſe advantage to offend us: for a ſmal body that can cover and gather it ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under a buckler, marcheth on towards the enemy with more ſurely then a bigger body doth, that lyeth at large &amp; open unto blowes. If it were not mine intention to husband the time, and to ſpare paper, I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my <hi>diſcourſe</hi> by reciting of almoſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nnumerable examples as well of Heathens as of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which have placed a great part of their perfection in poverty. But ye ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider one thing for all, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was poore, who was Lord of the whole world: his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were poore, which did
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:11482:96"/>poſſeſſe all things, and the Saints were poore which might have beene rich. If yee ſhould never dye, I would adviſe you to ſet your affection upon ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but I ſee to that thoſe to whom they moſt befall, doe finde ſooner the end of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then of their longing. Why then ſhould a man torment him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for a thing that he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily leave? and why is he not rather content quietly with that which is needfull, chiefly conſidering that the faireſt kind of wealth is for a man to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too poore, nor yet too far off from poverty?</p>

                        <hi>CAeſar</hi> ſayd well, that the beſt death was that which was leaſt premeditated; and to ſay truth, the preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before death hath bin to many a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torment, then the execution it ſelfe. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> ſalute their Infants comming forth of their Mothers wombe, thus; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, thou art come into the world to ſuffer; endure, ſuffer, and hold thy peace.</hi> Why then ſhould a man bee ſorry to dye, when nothing but life is miſerable. And it ſeemeth, that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities and misfortunes may bee borne with, either by the meanes of a long
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11482:97"/>cuſtome, or by the helpe of a ſtrong diſcourſe, onely Death and the apprehenſion thereof, is the thing that putteth us in greateſt feare.</p>
                     <p>Now the onely remedy and true eaſing of this evill, is that yee make this reckoning of the world, and all that is therein, that yee have nothing which is your owne, neither life, nor living, no not ſo much as your owne ſelfe; but that yee live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes borrowing and holding your very life, not in property, but on condition to reſtore it unto him againe, who hath lent it you, whenſoever he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it at your hands: yet for all this yee muſt not neglect it as a thing not yours, but muſt keepe it faithfully and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in regard that God hath truſted you with the cuſtody
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11482:97"/>thereof, and when it is time, to render it to him that gave it, not grudgingly, but gladly, and with a cheerefull countenance: in the meane time thanking GOD, the giver of all good things, for the time yee have had the uſe and aide thereof, and ſaying unto him in this, or the like manner; Lord, I render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee againe this Soule and Life, with as good an heart as it pleaſed thee to give mee the ſame, yea, even with a better and readier will then I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: for when thou gaveſt it me, thou gaveſt it to a little weake Creature, which knew not the good thou then didſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, but now thou doſt receive it againe at the hands of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more accompliſhed, who knoweth what it is he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into thine hands, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11482:98"/>rendereth it unto thee withall frankneſſe and readineſſe of will: and truely we may eaſily imagine that it is not a hard thing for a ſubſtance to returne to the place whence it firſt came, the body returning to the earth, and the ſoule (if it goe the right way) muſt goe to him that gave it. To bee ſhort, that man doubtleſſe never learned well to live, who knoweth not how to die: wee muſt therefore in this caſe bee ſo affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves, as wee are wont to be in the behalfe of fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which muſt fight in a barred field: for wee commonly hate him that beareth himſelfe faint-heartedly, and favour the other, who out of a brave courage had rather choſe to dye then to bee overcome. Beſides the feare of death is ſometimes the cauſe,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11482:98"/>or occaſion of it, to him that fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth faſteſt from it.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing yee know well, that life was given you upon condition to render it againe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Moreover men wil ſay, that it is a matter of great import, to wit, the feare, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of death, and that it is the extreame of all terrible things. But ye ought to underſtand that Death is not to bee found fault with for this, ſeeing that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from the nature of Death, but from our owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity: who are commonly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken and intangled with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11482:99"/>delights, with a deſire of this tranſitory life, and with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate love of this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleſh? And if yee take good heed, it is not ſo much Death i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>Sixe Orders of Chivalry, which continue at this day among Princes.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt and ancienteſt of theſe Orders of Chivalry, or Knighthood, is the Order of the Garter, inſtituted the yeare of our Lord 1348 in <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> chiefe Citty of the Dukedome of <hi>Guyne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> and then poſſeſſour of that Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which Order he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and dedicated to Saint <hi>George:</hi> Though the motive of the inſtitution thereof, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the loſſe of a Garter, which he ſuppoſed to have bin the Counteſſe of <hi>Salisburies:</hi> but I referre the <hi>Reader</hi> to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:11482:136"/>Chronicle. And it happened in this manner; as one day hee was entertaining her with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant talke, a Garter chanced to unlooſe and fall downe, the King endevouring to take it up, wittingly cauſed ſuch a jeſt as moved the Noblemen to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the Counteſſe thereat blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, and blaming that more then ſeemely familiarity of the King, for that hee had cauſed ſuch a jeſt among the aſſiſtance, ſaid ſharply to him, and the reſt, <hi>Honi ſoit qui maly penſe:</hi> which Engliſhed, is, <hi>Evill to him that evill thinketh.</hi> And the King in recompence of his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſayd forthwith, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were long, thoſe Noble men which had made a jeſt and laughing at the Garter fallen downe, ſhould eſteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much honoured to weare

There are of this Order 26 Knights, of which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:11482:137"/>the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes: and it is ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the excellency, that 8 Emperours, 22 forraigne Kings, 20 forraigne Dukes, and divers Noble-men of other Countries have beene fellows of it. About their necke they weare a blew Ribbond, at the end of which hangeth the Image of Saint <hi>George,</hi> upon whoſe day the inſtallation of the new Knights are commonly celebrated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three and twentieth of <hi>Aprill.</hi>

                     <p>And al though it was firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> yet the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, would that the ſiedge and place of the ſolemnizing thereof ſhould be at the Church of <hi>Windſor,</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi> where at the ſame time hee founded Canons, or a Canonry, for the better proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:11482:138"/>of the knights of the order.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond order in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, is the order of the Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, inſtituted Anno Dom. 1356 by <hi>Amede</hi> the ſixt of that name, Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the greene knight. The Knights of this order weare a great collar of gold, made win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with three laces which are called of love, wherein are enterlaced theſe words, <hi>FERT, FERT, FERT,</hi> every let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importing his Latin word, thus <hi>F. fortitudo, E, eius, R, Rhodum, T. tenuit</hi> that is his force hath conquered <hi>Rhodes:</hi> and at this Collar hangeth an image of our Lady, and of an Angell ſaluting her, and for that occaſion is called the Order of the Annuntiation. The collar is of 15 links, to ſhew the 15 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Virgine, each linke
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:11482:138"/>being inter-woven one with the other, in forme of a true Lovers knot. The number is fourteene Knights, the Solemnity is held annually on our <hi>Lady-day,</hi> in the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> This Earle ordayned this Order in memory of <hi>Amide</hi> the great, Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which ſuccoured the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> when they conquered the Ile of <hi>Rhodes</hi> upon the <hi>Turkes,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1310.</p>
                     <p>The third in antiquity is the Order of the golden Fleece, founded upon the fable of the golden Fleece, that <hi>Iaſon</hi> with the other <hi>Argonautes</hi> went to ſeeke in the Ile of <hi>Colchos,</hi> which is to ſay, that hee went to the Mine of Gold; or in Analogie to <hi>Gedeous</hi> Fleece, as ſome will, and ordayned by <hi>Philip</hi> the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:11482:139"/>ſecond, ſurnamed the good Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in the yeare 1430: the complete number of which Order were at firſt 25 Knights, and raiſed afterwards by the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> to 31. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift raiſed them to 51: and now there bee as many as the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> will inveſt with it. They weare a Coller of Gold, interlaced with an Iron, ſeeming to ſtrike fire out of a Flint, the word <hi>ex ferro flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam;</hi> and at the end hangs the Fleece, or <hi>Toiſon d'or:</hi> Their Cloaks and Hoods are of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, garded with Embroidery like flames of fire. <hi>Philip</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the celebrating of that Order St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 30 of <hi>November.</hi> But the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, (heire of the houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and chiefe of that Order) changed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:11482:139"/>their apparrell, and ordained that their Cloakes ſhould be of Crimſon Velvet, and their Hoods of Violet colour Velvet, and that underneath they ſhould weare a Caſſocke of cloath of Silver.</p>
                     <p>The fourth in antiquity is the Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angell, inſtituted by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11 of <hi>France,</hi> the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the yeare 1469: and ordained that of that Order there ſhould bee 36 Knights, which afterward were augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 300, Gentlemen of name and of Armes without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, of whom hee himſelfe was chiefe and Soveraigne, and after him his ſucceſſours Kings of <hi>France.</hi> And the brothers or companions of this Order were bound, at the receiving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to forſake and leave all other
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:11482:140"/>Orders, if any they had, either of a Prince or any company, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepting Emperors, Kings, and Dukes, which beſide this Order, might weare that Order whereof they were chiefe, with the agreement and conſent of the King and Brotherhood of the ſaid Order: and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſaid, King of <hi>France</hi> might weare beſide his owne, the Order of other Emperours, Kings, and Dukes. And for the connoiſſance of this Order, and the Knights thereof, he gave to every of them a Coller of Gold, wrought with Cockle ſhels, enterlacing one another with a double pointing Ribbon of Silke, with golden Tagges, the word, <hi>Immenſi Arenor Ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> which King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, becauſe his name was <hi>Francis,</hi> changed into a white
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:11482:140"/>Friars of <hi>Franciſcans</hi> Girdle, made of a twiſted corde; and hangeth on that Coller a tablet of St. <hi>Michael</hi> upon a Rocke, conquering the Divell. Of the inſtitution of this Order, is made a book, containing 98 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, wherein are ſet downe the things whereunto the Knights of this Order are ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The fift Order is that of the Holy Ghoſt, inſtituted by <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. King of <hi>France,</hi> on <hi>New-yeares</hi> day, in the yeare 1579 it was called by the name of the Holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this <hi>Henry</hi> was on a <hi>Whitſonday</hi> choſen King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Of this alſo is written a Booke, contayning the Articles whereunto the Knights thereof are bound. Among the which I have principally noted one, that is to defend and ſuſtaine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:11482:141"/>the Clergy: for the King doth give to every of them the rent of certaine Abbeyes, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, or other ſpirituall lands, whereof they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a certaine ſtipend, to the entertaining of a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of religious perſons, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry religious houſe under him; and for that benefit are ſworne at their entring into the ſayd Order, alwayes to defend the Spirituality, and maintaine the Clergy in their priviledges: but how they keepe their Oath, it is well ſeene in every place of their ſpirituall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and therof my ſelfe have oftentimes had ocular experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for travailing in that Countrey, and paſſing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by goodly religious hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I have ſometimes for recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (having well tryed the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:11482:141"/>courteous demeanor, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly religious men uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtrangers that come to view their houſes) entred into ſundry of them: where I have divers times bin ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the religious, how the King had given the rents and poſſeſſions of their houſes to the Knights of his Order, with the conditions already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, which Knights allow them ſuch bare exhibition, that by reaſon it is not ſufficient to entertaine the fourth part of the number by them appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, almoſt all of them are conſtrayned either to forſake their houſes, and begge, or elſe there to ſtarve: through which occaſion, many goodly religious houſes are of late fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in decay for want of repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, trimming up, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:11482:142"/>and will domore and more without a redreſſe. And this have I learned in divers religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, beſide the common murmuring of the Clergy: and ſo wee may ſee, how theſe Knights, called of the Holy Ghoſt, for to defend and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſpirituality, doe under pretence thereof, rob, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally waſte the ſpirituall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: ſo that it may ſeeme on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be a policy (under the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of better judgment) put in the Kings head, to diminiſh ſpirituall livings (which in that Countrey are wonderful great) and ſatisfie his prodigall minde, in rewarding by that meanes his flatterers; becauſe through his exceeding laviſhneſſe, hee is ſcarce able otherwiſe to reward them. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what diſmembring of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:11482:142"/>Church-lands, &amp; decay of <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice, commeth through this Order, in the Realme of <hi>France;</hi> will not grant the confirmation thereof, although the King hath beene inſtant for the ſame: but notwithſtanding the Popes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking thereof, the Order is maintained, though to the great weakning of the religion in that Countrey: Yea, at the laſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration thereof, which was on <hi>New-yeares</hi> day eeven, 1581, I ſaw three Biſhops were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that Order. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is of <hi>Flowers de lys,</hi> and flames of Gold, with a Croſſe, and a Dove on it pendent, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> wrought in Orenge tauny Velvet, garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed about with ſilver beames, which the Knights of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der weare upon their Cloakes, before their heart. Their robe is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:11482:143"/>a blacke Velvet Mantle, poude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Lillies and flames of Gold and Silver. None are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this Order, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proove their Nobility by three deſcents at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt Order is of the Bath, brought firſt into <hi>England</hi> 1399, by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: They are created at the Coronation of Kings and Queenes, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallation of the Princes of <hi>Wales:</hi> Their duty is to defend true Religion, Widdows, Maids, Orphans, and to maintaine the Kings rights.</p>
